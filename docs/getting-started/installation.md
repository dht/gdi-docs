# Installation

> Note: make sure you have all the [prerequisites](./prerequisites.md) prepared before installation

## Install the CLI

Run:

```sh
npm install -g @gdi/cli
```

and rebuild the CLI's commands index:

```sh
gdi rebuild
```

## Create a new site

```sh
gdi create site [site-name]
```

> Note: this clones the template and installs dependencies and may take a few moments

A new project with two main packages was created:

- `gdi-admin`: holds the admin UI
- `gdi-site`: holds the public facing site

Change your `cwd` to your newly created `root` folder:

```sh
cd [site-name]
```

and install the project's dependencies:

```sh
npm i
```

or:

```sh
yarn
```

## Connect Firebase

Bootstrap the project:

```sh
gdi bootstrap
```

> Note: Before bootstrapping make sure you have [firebase-tools](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) installed: npm install -g firebase-tools

## Running the Admin UI

In the project's `root` run:

```sh
gdi start
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Setting the admin user

Log in to the [Admin UI](http://localhost:3000/admin) with your `Google Account`.

Then, in the project's `root` run:

```sh
gdi setAdmin
```

## Deploying

In the project's `root` run:

```sh
gdi deploy
```

> Note: this will deploy both the `Admin UI` and the `Site`

After a successful deployment, the `Admin UI` will be served from the `/admin` path.

> Note: change your site's favIcons and meta tags before deployment
