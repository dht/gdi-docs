# Project's Goals

The project inspires to simplify the process of deploying complex `CMS Web Applications` while still giving us developers the easy-of-use and familiarity we've been accustomed to with open-source tools such as `VSCode`, `Iterm` other modern tools.

## Schema-Based Layouts

By defining layouts and data structures with simple `JSON` schemas, several advantages are presented:

1. Import / export of entities become easier
2. Switching design without changing underlying data is possible
3. Centralized data management is possible with versioned interfaces

## Many-to-many Architecture

By separating the `data stores` layer from the `apps` layer and the `UI` layer, you can achieve complex scenarios and allow developers to extend both functionally and layouts on top of existing `data structures`.

## Utilize Firebase

Firebase's `Spark` plan offers a variety of `no-cost` hosting, database, analytics and authentication features which seem like a good fit for self-hosted CMS systems.

## Project in Motion

The Project was launched on `September 2022` and is in its infancy.
Those goals mentioned above are expected to evolve, contract and expand. You are invited to take part in the discussion in the [discord channel](https://discord.gg/egAbyQHRrm) and bring your own thoughts and fresh ideas.
